### how to install?
1) download the .jar from releases that match your os, and rename it to `demise` (keep the file extension the same plz)
2) download the .json from `/json/demise.json`
3) create a new folder in minecraft's version dir named `demise`, and put both of the files in there
4) go on the vanilla mc launcher (sk, tl and others work too) and create a new installation using the `demise` version
5) launch using the [HMCL launcher](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL) (select the jar version, you can use multimc or prism, but they are way harder to set up)
   <br> <b> make sure to use java 17 </b>

### the client is in early development, feel free to report any bugs in the issues or on the discord server
